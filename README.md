I tried to copy a design I found here : https://dribbble.com/shots/20819618-Food-Ordering-App
made it from scratch with html css and javascript 
besides just copying the design i added a little bit of functionality 
  : all the buttons are interactable (and do what you would expect them to) and for good measure, I added a light/dark mode toggle.
